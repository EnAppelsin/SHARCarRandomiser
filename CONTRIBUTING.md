# How to contribute
We welcome all forms of contribution to help make this mod great, and many people have already contributed for which we are very grateful.

## Bugs & Features
If you have found an issue with the randomiser (such a crash!) please file an issue on [our issue tracker](https://github.com/EnAppelsin/SHARCarRandomiser/issues).
Please use the templates provided, especially for bugs, and be as detailed as you can! If we can reproduce the bug it's much easier for us to fix it!

In order to assist troubleshooting you can enable the 'Console' mod in Lucas' Mod Launcher, and ensure 'Mods' is enabled in Console's settings, this will create a window where some diagnostic information (such as chosen randomisations) will be displayed during the game. This may be particularly helpful if you would like to fix the bug yourself.

## Code
Want to fix a bug? Add a feature? We welcome code contributions no matter how small as a [pull request](https://github.com/EnAppelsin/SHARCarRandomiser/pulls).
To contribute we suggest you fork the repository on GitHub and make your edits. Once you are satisfied open a pull request to merge it. 
We operate two major branches:
- `master` contains the *stable* version of the randomiser
- `dev` contains the *development* version of the randomiser

New features should always target the dev branch, for bug fixes target the version you found the bug, and we may change the branch depending on development progress. 

We will review all pull requests and provide feedback if we feel extra changes are necessary.
We may be able to provide the changes ourselves, but please expect to perform some modifications particularly if the change is large.
