# Simpsons Hit & Run Randomiser
![The Randomiser](RandomiserBanner.png)

This mod allows for randomising vehicles and characters throughout the game.
Each randomisation has it's own option, detailed below.

## Installation
Copy the mod file (.lmlm) to your Mods folder (usually Documents\My Games\Lucas' Simpsons Hit & Run Mod Launcher\Mods)
Run the Mod Launcher and change the settings to match your needs, then play the game.
All possible randomisations are available in separate settings.

## Settings

You can change the vehicles by cancelling the mission first and starting it again.
If this is disabled you'll get random mission vehicles each time you restart.
#### Random stats
On by default.
If this is checked, all randomised vehicles will have random stats. To customise, use the Random Stat Variables page.
### Random Stat Variables
##### Vehicle Mass
The mass of the vehicle can effect how it interacts with the ground, the lower the mass value of the vehicle is; the less friction will act upon it making the world an ice rink.
Notice: It is believed that mass affects the toughness of a vehicle.
##### Gas Scale
The Gas scale is the acceleration of the vehicle if you were to just hold the acceleration button.
##### Slip Gas Scale
The Slip Gas Scale is the acceleration of a vehicle while it is sliding from speed or through the e-break
##### Break Gas Scale
The Break Gas Scale is the breaking speed of a vehicle when it is not sliding or e-breaking.
##### Vehicle Speed
Provides a value for the top speed of the vehicle
##### Wheel Turn Angle
The turn angle of the wheel effects how the vehicle steers, too high of a value being used can cause uncontrollability with a vehicle.
#####High Speed Steering Drop
High Speed Steering Drop changes the turn angle when the vehicle is close to its highest speed - making it harder to drive.
##### Wheel Grip
The wheel grip controls how the car will drift when it is driving - primarily on acceleration and steering - the higher the grip the more likely the car is to drift.
##### Steering
This controls the steering of the vehicle
##### Slip Steering
This controls the steering of the vehicle while in a drift
##### HP
This controls the amount of health that a vehicle has - The Armoured truck in 5-6 has 15 HP
### Misc
#### Gameplay Changes
##### Remove car/costume requirements
Off by default.
If this is checked, you won't need to be wearing a specific costume/be driving a specific car to start a mission.
Removes the need for a coin route.
##### Skip cutscenes (except intro cutscene)
Off by default.
If this is checked, all cutscenes bar the introduction cutscene won't be played.
##### Increase HP for weak cars
Off by default.
If this is checked weak cars like the rocket car will have their HP slightly boosted so they're not quite as fragile.
It raises the minimum HP to 0.8 for all cars.
#### Misc
##### No Husk (Destroyed Car)
On by default.
If this is checked the destroyed car (husk) is not in the list of random cars to use.
The husk can cause problems with certain missions.
	
## Potential Limitations/Issues
- Missions will spawn you where you start if you restart the mission once, this is because adding a forced car teleports you.

- The list of cars to chose from is built into the script and so if you use mods which add extra cars they won't be chosen,
and if a mod removes cars the game will crash if the randomiser picks it.

- Your car will vanish at the end of the mission, even if you are in it. Again this is because of how forced cars work.

- There is a spot where random characters will be sat in mid air. This is due to how passengers/drivers work.
