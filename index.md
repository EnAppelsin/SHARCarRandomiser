![The Randomiser](RandomiserBanner.png)

This mod allows for randomising vehicles, characters and almost everything else in the game!

## Download
Downloads are available [on GitHub's releases page](https://github.com/EnAppelsin/SHARCarRandomiser/releases)

## Installation
You will need [Lucas' Simpsons Hit & Run Mod Launcher](https://donutteam.com/downloads/Launcher/) to run this mod.

Copy the mod file (.lmlm) to your Mods folder (usually Documents\My Games\Lucas' Simpsons Hit & Run Mod Launcher\Mods).  

Run the Mod Launcher and change the settings to match your needs, then play the game.  
All possible randomisations are available in separate settings.

Information about every setting can be found [on this page](settings.html)

## Future Plans
- Seeded RNG

- Random locations (possibly)
	
## Potential Limitations/Issues
If you find more issues, please report them on our discord or [GitHub](https://github.com/EnAppelsin/SHARCarRandomiser/issues)

- Missions will spawn you where you start if you restart the mission once, this is because adding a forced car teleports you.

- Your car will vanish at the end of the mission, even if you are in it. Again this is because of how forced cars work.

- There is a spot where random characters will be sat in mid air. This is due to how passengers/drivers work.

- The game probably will crash, this is because the mod is complicated and the game does not appreciate a lot of changes
